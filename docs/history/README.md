# History

## Project Inspiration
The History behind the project is simple; I was tired of storing my keys on paper and I did not want
the usability cost of using an hardware wallet. I thought a while about the issue and came to a conclusion.
I could have one card that acted as a main storage key and add a passphrase to this card for each wallet that I used. Now instead of having a draw filled with paper with my keys scribbled on them, I could have one main card and just produce passphrase when I needed them. The passphrase could be stored by whatever means I wanted to, such as being online in my email or irl on metal, if I wanted to. This base idea lead me to learn more about bip 39.
